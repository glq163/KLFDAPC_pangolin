The conservation of biodiversity and global public health are increasingly at risk due to the traffic in wild animals, particularly medicinal species, which may harbor zoonotic pathogens. Accurate geographic tracing of wildlife is essential for combating poaching and illegal trade, as well as for understanding the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. Traditional methods such as isotopic analysis, haplotype networks, and phylogenetic trees provide limited spatial resolution and are time-consuming. Here, we employ a real-time, high-throughput, and cost-effective DNA-Driven machine learning approach to trace the geographic origin of wildlife individuals. We accurately predicted the geographic locations of 279 forest musk deer and 94 Chinese pangolins, two species critically impacted by illegal trade, from their DNA data. Our findings not only validate the approach's effectiveness but also highlight its potential to inform and refine conservation strategies, offering a powerful new lens through which to view and protect endangered species.
